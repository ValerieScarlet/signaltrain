 
 A compressor affect has not been possible for most of the history of this project.  Recently, adding skip connections to the shrink-grow FNN spectral model was able to produce something roughly matching the compressor:

 The blip in the loss history is where the run was interrupted & restarted.
 
 More work is needed.

 (Note: I say "compressor" instead of "compression", only to distinguish this dynamic-range compression from "data compression".)
