Running the network as an "identity" operation (with `--effect=id`) results in an autoencoder.

Using the checkpoint file from this autoencoder can provide a ready means of initializing the network weights (`--init`) for new tasks.

But because this checkpoint file is 2.6 GB, we don't commit it to GitHub. ;-) 

...more later.
